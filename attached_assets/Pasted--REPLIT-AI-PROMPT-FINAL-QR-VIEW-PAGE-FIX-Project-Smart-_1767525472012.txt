🔷 REPLIT AI PROMPT (FINAL – QR & VIEW PAGE FIX)

Project: Smart Seminar & Event Management System (SSEMS)
Status: Core system already working (Admin, Guard, Seminar creation, seat grid, QR scan, PDF generation)

Task: Fix and clearly separate Show QR and View Page behavior for seminars.

🎯 REQUIRED BEHAVIOR (DO NOT CHANGE)

On Admin Dashboard → Seminar Card, there are two buttons:

🔹 Button 1: Show QR

Purpose: Student registration entry

When clicked:

Show a QR code

QR code URL MUST point to:

/{seminarSlug}/register


When a student scans this QR:

Open Student Registration Page

Show:

Full seminar details

Student registration form

Student clicks Next

Redirect to seat selection

Student selects seat → clicks Register

PDF ticket auto-downloads

🔹 Button 2: View Page

Purpose: Read-only seminar details

Redirects to:

/{seminarSlug}


This page must show:

Full seminar details

Same QR code (linking to /register)

❌ NO student form

❌ NO seat selection

❌ NO registration action

🧭 ROUTING STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

Implement three separate routes:

/{seminarSlug}              → SeminarDetailsPage (View Page)
/{seminarSlug}/register     → StudentRegisterPage
/{seminarSlug}/seats        → SeatSelectionPage


Do NOT merge these pages.

🧾 STUDENT REGISTER PAGE

Route: /{seminarSlug}/register

UI Requirements

Seminar title, date, time, venue

Student form:

School / College Name (optional)

Course (required ONLY if college name filled)

Semester (required ONLY if college name filled)

Phone number (required)

Next button

Logic

On clicking Next:

Temporarily store student data (state or Firestore draft)

Redirect to:

/{seminarSlug}/seats

🪑 SEAT SELECTION PAGE

Route: /{seminarSlug}/seats

Use existing seat grid logic

Prevent double booking

On clicking Register:

Save final registration

Generate unique receipt ID

Auto-download PDF

PDF Must Include

Seminar details

Student details

Seat number

Receipt ID

QR code for guard verification

🛂 GUARD FLOW (DO NOT BREAK)

Guard QR scanning must continue working

QR inside PDF should validate attendance correctly

Duplicate scans must be prevented

⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT break existing Admin / SuperAdmin / Guard dashboards

Do NOT remove working seat logic

Do NOT skip student form

Keep code clean and commented

Use React Router properly

✅ FINAL GOAL

After implementation:

✅ Show QR → opens student registration page

✅ View Page → shows details + QR only

✅ Student flow: Form → Seat → PDF

✅ Guard scan works as before

END OF PROMPT
