🔷 REPLIT AI PROMPT (FIX QR → STUDENT FLOW)

Context:
I already have a working prototype of Smart Seminar & Event Management System (SSEMS) with:

College registration

Role-based login (SuperAdmin / Admin / Guard)

Admin can create seminars with seat grids

Admin dashboard shows seminars with Show QR and View Page

Seat selection page already exists and works

Problem to fix:
When a student scans the QR code, it directly opens the seat selection page, skipping the student registration form. I want to fix the routing and flow.

🎯 REQUIRED STUDENT FLOW (VERY IMPORTANT)

Student scans QR

QR opens Student Registration Page

Student fills personal details

Clicks Confirm

Redirects to Seat Selection Page

Selects seat and clicks Register

PDF ticket auto-downloads with QR for guard verification

🛠 TASKS TO IMPLEMENT
1️⃣ Fix QR Code Generation (CRITICAL)

Update QR code value so it points to:

/seminar/:seminarId


❌ Do NOT point QR to seat selection
❌ Do NOT skip student form

2️⃣ Create Student Registration Page

Route

/seminar/:id


Page Requirements

Fetch seminar details using id

Display:

Seminar title, date, time, venue

Student input form:

School / College Name (optional)

Course (required ONLY if college name is filled)

Semester (required ONLY if college name is filled)

Name (required)

Email (required)

Phone number (required)

Validate inputs properly

“Confirm” button

3️⃣ Redirect to Seat Selection After Confirm

On clicking Confirm:

Temporarily store student data (state or Firestore draft)

Navigate to:

/seminar/:id/seats


Pass student data forward

4️⃣ Seat Selection Page (Reuse Existing)

Route

/seminar/:id/seats


Use existing seat grid logic

Ensure seat locking

On clicking Register:

Save full registration (student + seat)

Mark seat as booked

Generate unique receipt ID

5️⃣ PDF Ticket Auto-Download

Generate PDF automatically after successful registration

PDF must include:

Seminar details

Student details

Seat number

Unique receipt ID

QR code for guard verification

6️⃣ Guard QR Compatibility (DO NOT BREAK)

Guard QR scanning logic must continue working

QR inside PDF should contain:

/verify/:ticketId

📁 CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

Do NOT break existing Admin, SuperAdmin, or Guard flows

Keep routing clean and readable

Use React Router properly

Add comments explaining:

Why QR route was changed

Student flow logic

🎯 FINAL GOAL

After this fix:

Scanning QR opens student registration form

Seat selection only appears after confirmation

PDF auto-downloads successfully

Flow matches real-world seminar systems
